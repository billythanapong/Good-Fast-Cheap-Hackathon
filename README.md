This project has given a dataset with one constraint which is **the number of samples around only 6000 rows**, but able to use any features and algorithm. The project time is within 6 hours to build the best model possible under the constraint and prepare the presentation of the process and findings. The task is to predict if a person's income is in excess of $50,000 given certain profile information, and more specifically to generate predicted probabilities of income being above $50,000 for each row in the test set. This will simply be a csv with a single column of the probability with 'wage' as a header.

**Finally, we use logistic regression instead due to the interpret ability to explain and the fast algorithm to execute that come with the F1-score on testing set (over 16000 rows) of 79.7%**
